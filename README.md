# Personal Portfolio

## Blake Trester 

**Goal:**

My primary goal for this project was to create a personal portfolio for myself while practicing everything that I have learned up until this point. During this project I was able to identify areas that I needed to practice more as well as learned my strengths in creating responsive and appealing websites. This project is benificial not only for gaining more experience and practice, but it will also double as something I can continue to update and use to help grow my professional career. Having a strong portfolio will help me stand out to industry professionals and potential future employers.

**Building a Responsive Website**
- I was tasked with building a personal website from scratch. I started by building a solid foundation for the website in HTML, including good use of semantic html and adding comments to help better organize the index file. I added functional links to my navigation bar that will direct the viewer to different sections throughout the website. Using my background in graphic design, I created images that I felt would be a good fit for my page and inserted them into their appropriate locations within the page. I made sure all images included and alt text tag to help with accessability. 

- I used CSS to start styling the website with many different design elements that would help my portfolio page become more visually appealing while still remaining fully functional. I changed the font and sizes of the text and added background color to make everything stand out more to anyone who views the page. I also added runded borders and drop shadows to the images so they would look more dynamic. I included hover effects to all of the links so they would be more impressionable before someone clicks them.

- I made sure the entire website had good responsive design so that it will look good on any size screen across multiple types of devices. I made sure to clean up and condense my code so it would be easier to read I want to work on this project again. Throughout the time I spent working on this project, I made sure to consistantly update my repository and included informative commit messages to help when updating in the future.
